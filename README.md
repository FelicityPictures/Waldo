# Waldo
__By Felicity Ng, Rick Melucci, & David Rothblatt__

Waldo is a basic search engine using the google api.
- For fun, ask "Where is Waldo?" and see what happens!


## How to use
Type your question into the box and submit the answer. We can answer your questions about the secret (or not so secret) identities of people, the locations of certain things around the world, and dates in case you forget when the next holiday is!

To ask something else, click the back button and ask away!

##Warning
Since we don't have Google-type firepower in terms of data-crunching power, the program will take extremely long to run on the average Joe's computer. In the future we would try to assemble a more efficient algorithm and would definitely stock up on a brolic server that could crunch the data more quickly.

Do ask "Where is Waldo" though!
